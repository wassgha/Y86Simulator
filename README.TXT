This project is a simulation of the Y86 Instruction Set Architechture
made in Java (Swing). It has the minimal components of a processor
(main memory, bus, registers, ALU, etc.) and it simulates simple
assembly programs.

PROJECT TITLE: Y86 Processor Simulator
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Simulate the functioning of a processor running the
Y86 Instruction Set Architechture
VERSION or DATE: October 31st
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: To run this project use “java Simulation”
AUTHORS: Wassim Gharbi
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Modify config.txt and rtn.txt to play with different
combinations of parameters for the virtual processor
